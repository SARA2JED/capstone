Capstone Project for Misk Data Science Immersive Course 2021
this project was created to test demonstrate my data since knowledge and nlp skills i've learned in this course

## features 
- data cleaning (remove stop words / lemmatizing / vectorizing )

- clustering similar words together using k-mean clustering  

- measure similarity using sklearn libraries 

### future work to be added 
- map emojis to the clusters 
- add a recommendation system that return a song based on emojis inputted by the user

### extra work 
- topic modeling using gensim 

## Data
this data set was scraped from Vagalume by Anderson Neisse 
for this project we only used the lyrics dataset that contained :
- Sname : name for song 
- lyrics : one string containing all the lyrics in the song 
- Idiom : language of the song

### example 
| SName  | lyrics |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| More Than This  | I could feel at the time. There was no way of ...	  |
| Because The Night	Take me now  | baby, here as I am. Hold me close...	  |


## how to run the files 
run the files in the following order to get the best result from the model 
 - text cleaning 
 - k mean clustering 
 - similarity
